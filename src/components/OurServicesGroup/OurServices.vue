            Servers & cloud computing: matching a (virtual) server to your data needs.
            When it comes to small business servers, virtual servers or cloud computing, there are a myriad of server options. Selecting the right fit for your network size,
            backup preferences and data requirements will reduce downtime, facilitate faster installation of new applications, give you the option of managing email and even hosting your own website.

              <br><br><b>Cloud Computing</b><br><br>
              The trend toward cloud computing simply involves moving your data storage and/or setting up specific business applications on the internet, so the data or software is not stored at your office or workplace. Benefits of cloud computing include the increased ability to access data remotely, reduced hardware outlays and upgrades, and the reassurance of off-site storage for backup and recovery – an advantage in the event of another earthquake. Cloud computing works best when you have a high-speed data cable for internet connections. If your internet connection is based on copper wires or is unreliable, then cloud computing may not be the ideal solution.


              <br><br><br><b>Small Business Servers</b><br><br>
              Increasing workloads place increasing demands on your servers. With a proven track record of successful installation, we can help to specify and source a small business server to store and traffic your data, whether you've got 4 computers in your office or 400! Our server-based computing solutions offer a range of features, including:

              <br><em>Extensive research and development behind each solution design</em><br>
              <em>Seamless, reliable and predictable user experience</em><br>
              <em>Consistent performance</em><br>
              <em>Full-feature functionality</em><br>
              <em>Extends application access to employees, business partners, vendors and customers</em><br>


              <br><br><br><b>Virtual Server Options</b><br><br>
              A virtual server is popular for businesses with large data storage needs, proprietary software, multiple websites, or a strong online presence. Because your website is hosted on its own [usually large] server, you don't have to compete with other websites for access. A virtual server is more secure than shared servers and enables you to create your own software programmes.

              Take the guesswork out of choosing servers for your business computer systems. Talk to us about selecting the server management system that will optimise your business, not jeopardise it.

              If you have a sizeable network which requires multiple software installations and servicing there are benefits of partnering in our regular, server-based computing service:

              Rapid deployment of applications and accelerated upgrades
              Instant on-delivery of applications from a single point over any connection

              <br><br><b>We're your backup and recovery experts.</b><br>
              Why does your business need a backup and recovery plan? Being prepared and organised to mitigate the risk of outages and productivity through IT disaster recovery is extremely important for any company. From virus infections to accidental fire, flood damage and even malicious damage, you need to have procedures in place to combat any level of threat – not to mention seismic wobbles!

              Manage IT can help you to prepare a disaster recovery IT plan by reviewing and establishing backup and recovery systems. Like all disaster plans, few companies prepare for them fully until something actually happens and by then it's too late. Considering disaster recovery IT procedures is important for the continued success of your business.

              At Manage IT, we can provide on-site and/or external backup and recovery solutions that best suit your business needs and business requirements at an appropriate price. This can be provided in a mixture of solutions such as locally attached storage right through to cloud-based storage, or even high-availablility virtualisation.

              Formalising the defined disaster recovery strategy under a service level agreement (SLA) ensures that the strategy is regularly checked and maintained, providing you with an assurance that the solution is working and that we have an agreed formalised backup and recovery action plan to address the problem should the managed system fail.

              For most clients it is always our recommendation that an image-based disaster recovery strategy is implemented. It is a well established solution that captures the entire build of the computer and allows you to transfer this build to another piece of hardware within a few hours (depends on the amount of data). As required, we can respond by providing a same-day spare machine, or a complete network refresh, or an overnight office refit – whatever the situation demands.

              <br><br><b>Tips to consider when putting together a backup and recovery plan:</b><br>
              1. Critical Information:
              Ask yourself a simple question. If we had a major failure where all critical data was lost, how long could the business function before it would negatively impact on its operation? The answer to this question should define the customised backup and recovery strategy to meet your requirements.

              <br><br><b>Virtual Server Options</b><br>
              A virtual server is popular for businesses with large data storage needs, proprietary software, multiple websites, or a strong online presence. Because your website is hosted on its own [usually large] server, you don't have to compete with other websites for access. A virtual server is more secure than shared servers and enables you to create your own software programmes.

              Take the guesswork out of choosing servers for your business computer systems. Talk to us about selecting the server management system that will optimise your business, not jeopardise it.


              <br><br><b>2. Basic Critical Data Requirements (Traditional Strategies):</b><br>
              Any data that is stored either on a local computer and/or in the cloud, should include a basic level of redundancy. This includes redundancy around the hard drives which house the data through to capturing the critical data to an external device that can be stored off site (e.g. tape streamer, RDX, DVD and/or external hard drive).
              <br><br><b>3. Cloud Storage:</b><br>
              Since the earthquakes, cloud storage has been in increased demand. Designed to capture incremental files changed in a local data repository through to data and computer changes at an image level, this solution is becoming a preferred disaster recovery IT strategy. Providing the assurances around the backup being off site, provisioning for archieval retrieval and as required restoration from a flat file through to a virtualised computer on the internet, the cloud storage solution is becoming the preferred solution.
              <br><br><b>4. Complete Failure:</b><br>
              In the event of a complete disaster where your office is totally inaccessible, we can retrieve your backup data and install either onto loan equipment, new equipment and/or in a virtualised environment based in the cloud or locally on site so as to allow your business to get back onto its feet.

              Talk to our Manage IT team about your backup and recovery requirements. It doesn't matter if your desktop needs replacement parts or your entire network needs to be replicated off-site, Manage IT provide the reassurance and peace of mind you welcome from disaster recovery IT experts.

            We're not dressed up in black suits with dark glasses and earpiece communication devices. We do however have a number of options to keep a close eye on the security of your business' computing systems, ensuring that the mafia are not infiltrating your network.

              Security standards are always changing to keep up with the fast pace of the IT world. This is why it's so important to use an IT consulting company like Manage IT. We have our eyes on the ball all the time, adapting to changes as they happen in order to provide your IT infrastructure with the latest and most secure security systems available.


              Our various external and internal security measures include:

              <br><br><b>External measures</b><br>
              Security audit<br>
              Hardware firewalls (managed and unmanaged)<br>
              Email relay tests - These tests ensure that the email server on your network does not allow other email servers to connect and send email via it. Spammers often locate an open relay server and exploit it to send spam.<br>
              Hosted and on-premise email and proxy filters – Threat metrics scan for viruses, spam and other potential threats.<br>
              <br><br><b>Internal measures</b><br>
              User Account Policy - Account policies are the rules that control user account authentication parameters. <br>
              Password protection - Password policies can define specific password requirements such as maximum password age, minimum length, account lockout, failed login attempts etc. <br>
              Security Accounts – Certain network authority accounts can have elevated priveleges on the network. <br>
              VPN Access – You can specify the users that should have the ability to access the network remotely via a VPN connection. <br>
              <br><br>
              We also provide summary reports with security updates and recommendations regarding your network. And when required we can provide a comprehensive security audit which is completed by a third party security specialist. You can read more about these in our different business IT support service packages.

            <b>Generally speaking the 'Cloud' refers to the internet.</b><br><br>
            So Cloud computing is computing over the internet. <br>
            The value to Cloud varies. The main benfits include the scope you can create to focus on other things by giving responsibilty for maintenance and upkeep of servers and software to someone else; the peace of mind that comes with knowing you can go about your business from anywhere you can find an internet connection, and not be exposed to the downtime risks associated with a fixed location; and finally, having the ability to bring greater certainty to cashflow by replacing irregular and often heavy capital expenditure with regular and predictable operational expenditure.
